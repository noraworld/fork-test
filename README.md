# Fork test
This repository is fork test. I will fork this from organization account to my own account. If the original repository (based on organization account) has been deleted, what happens to the forked repository (based on my own account)? I will verify it.

## Verification result
Yay! The forked repository was not deleted even if the original repository was deleted. Of course, the link that traces to the original repository was deleted.
